# JC's Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

In order to prepare for my coding Bootcamp, I wanted to create a study guide that covered all of the topics (HTML, CSS, Git, JavaScript) in the Prework. I built it so I could see my primary bullet points of each topic in an organized, easy-to-view fashion. With  this study guide I should be able to access all of the information I need quickly and easily.

Console panel should open either BELOW or TO THE SIDE of the webpage in the browser. In that panel will be a list of all of the topics covered along with a suggestion for what to study first.
